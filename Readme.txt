UPDATED FOR XP-864 in 2009

In 1977, two F-16's were "customized" (hence the reason for this aircraft being placed in CUSTOM DESIGNS) by General Dynamics in Ft. Worth Texas with a cranked-arrow delta wing design [the F-16XL's] and participated in the USAF search for a replacement of their F-111 Aardvark. The USAF requirements were for an aircraft capable of deep interdiction missions without the aid or assistance of additional fighter support or jamming support. The two aircraft that went head to head to replace the aging F-111 were the F-16XL and the presented day F-15E. The Air Force selected the two seater  F-15E. 

Later (in 1988) the Air Force turned the two F-16XL's over to NASA. When NASA had completed their testing of these aircraft in 1999, they place these two aircraft into their storage unit at NASA Dryden. [NOTE: the second F-16XL was a two seater version like the F-15E].

INTERESTING FACTS: The cranked-arrow delta wing is 120% larger than the original winged F-16 which resulted in a 25% improvement in maximum lift-to-drag ratio in supersonic flight and 11% in subsonic flight which resulted in an aircraft that handled much smoother at high speeds and low altitudes. The cranked-arrow delta wing design gave this aircraft an 82% increase in fuel capacity, and it could carry TWICE the ordance of a normal F-16 (at that time) and deliver its payload at a 40% further increase in range. In my opinion, there are several aircraft that should have made it into the Air Force's inventory, and this is one of those such aircraft.

In keeping with the redistribution requirements, this aircraft is freeware and is intended solely for personal and non-commerical uses. It may not be sold. This F-16XL was created by Andrew Bright and Ethan Tieger, with XP-8.15 modifications and paint by Barry Leger and later upgraded in 2009 for XP-8.64 by Russell Gleason.
